# 🏡 KingCountyHomes: Real Estate Price Analysis and Prediction

## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes a dataset of home sales in King County, Washington (including the city of Seattle), with the goal of identifying the key factors that influence property prices and developing predictive models for estimating home values.

The analysis is conducted from the perspective of a Data Analyst working for a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) interested in making informed investment decisions in the residential real estate market.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It includes features such as:

- Square footage of the lot and the house  
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- Number of floors  
- Presence of a waterfront  
- Year built and renovated  
- Zip code and location info  
- Price (target variable)

## 🧠 Project Structure

The project is divided into several key modules:

1. **Data Importing** – Loading the dataset and necessary libraries  
2. **Data Wrangling** – Cleaning and preprocessing the data  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing and understanding variable relationships  
4. **Model Development** – Building linear regression models  
5. **Model Evaluation and Refinement** – Evaluating models using R² and cross-validation, then refining for better performance

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Linear Regression and Ridge Regression  
- Visualization techniques for EDA

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a reliable regression model that can predict house prices based on various property features, ultimately guiding real estate investment strategies.
